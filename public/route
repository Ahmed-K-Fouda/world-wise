-- what is routing?
we are match different url to different UI views.
e.g => www.example.com , www.example.com/login.

- the routing enable users to navigate between diffrent application screen using browser url.

- and keep UI in sync with browser url

-- we use routing using third library called ==> React Router

-- this allow us to build Single Page Application (SPA)

-- the SPA => executed entirley on the client(browser)

-- how SPA work => user click router link ==> the url changed ==> DOM is updated ==> the page is never reloaded feel like a native app

-- to install => npm i react-router-dom
<BrowserRouter>
<Routes>
<Route path = 'pricing' element = {Pricing}></Route>
</Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
